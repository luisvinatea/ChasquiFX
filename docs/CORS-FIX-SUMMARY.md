# CORS Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem Fixed

We've resolved the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error that was preventing the frontend application at `https://chasquifx-web.vercel.app` from communicating with the backend API at `https://chasquifx-api.vercel.app`.

## Changes Made

1. Modified `vercel.json` to use a wildcard (\*) for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header
2. Updated CORS headers in all serverless function files (`forex.js`, `health.js`, `db-status.js`) to include all necessary headers:
   - Authorization
   - X-Serpapi-Key
   - X-Search-Api-Key
   - X-Exchange-Api-Key
3. Created documentation and testing scripts:
   - Updated CORS configuration guide
   - Added CORS update documentation
   - Created a CORS testing script
   - Created a deployment script

## Next Steps

To deploy the fix to production:

1. Run the deployment script:

   ```bash
   ./deploy-api-cors-fix.sh
   ```

2. After the deployment completes, test the CORS configuration:

   ```bash
   ./test-cors-config.sh
   ```

3. Verify that the frontend application can now communicate with the backend by:
   - Visit https://chasquifx-web.vercel.app
   - Check the browser console to confirm no CORS errors appear
   - Verify API status indicators show successful connections

## Documentation

- Updated CORS configuration documentation in:
  - `backend/api/docs/cors-configuration-guide.md`
  - `backend/api/docs/cors-update-may-2025.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `UPDATE-SUMMARY.md`

## Testing

The testing script checks:

1. Whether proper CORS headers are returned for OPTIONS requests
2. Whether the API returns proper data for GET requests with Origin headers
3. Whether all necessary headers are included in the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response

Note: It may take a few minutes after deployment for the changes to propagate through Vercel's network.
