# ChasquiFX MongoDB Connection Fix Guide

## Problem Summary

The ChasquiFX application is currently experiencing multiple API errors:

- 500 Internal Server Error responses from all API endpoints
- CORS errors when trying to access the API
- Connection failures in the frontend

These issues are primarily due to MongoDB connection problems in the backend API deployment.

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the error logs and code, we've identified several potential issues:

1. **MongoDB Authentication Failure**: The MongoDB Atlas credentials stored in the Vercel environment variables might be incorrect or outdated.

2. **MongoDB Connection String Format**: The connection string format in `mongodb-vercel.js` is correct, but it might be using incorrect host information or credentials.

3. **MongoDB Access Control**: The MongoDB Atlas instance might not allow connections from Vercel's IP addresses.

## Fix Steps

We've created a script to help diagnose and fix these issues:

### 1. Run the Fix Script

```bash
./fix-mongodb-connection.sh
```

This script will:
- Prompt you for your MongoDB Atlas credentials
- Create a new `.env` file with these credentials
- Test the MongoDB connection
- Optionally deploy to Vercel with the updated credentials

### 2. Verify the Connection

After running the script, it will automatically test if the MongoDB connection works. If successful, you'll see:

```
âœ… Successfully connected to MongoDB!
Found X collections:
- collection1
- collection2
...
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

The script will ask if you want to deploy to Vercel immediately. If you choose yes, it will:
- Update the environment variables in Vercel
- Deploy the updated code to Vercel

If you choose no, you can manually deploy later by following the instructions provided by the script.

## Verifying the Fix

After deployment, you should test the API endpoints to confirm they're working:

1. Check the basic health endpoint:
   ```
   curl https://chasquifx-api.vercel.app/health
   ```

2. Check the forex status endpoint:
   ```
   curl https://chasquifx-api.vercel.app/api/v2/forex/status
   ```

3. Open the frontend application and verify it can connect to the API without errors.

## MongoDB Setup Information

Your MongoDB configuration is set to use:

- **Cluster Host**: chasquifx.ymxb5bs.mongodb.net
- **Database Name**: chasquifx
- **Required Collections**: forex, flights, geo
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - MONGODB_USER
  - MONGODB_PASSWORD
  - MONGODB_HOST
  - MONGODB_DBNAME

## Support

If you continue to experience issues after following these steps, please review:

- The MongoDB Atlas dashboard for connection logs and errors
- The Vercel deployment logs for API errors
- The browser console for frontend connection errors
