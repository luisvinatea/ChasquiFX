# ChasquiFX API Status Update - May 20, 2025

## Current Status

1. ✅ **CORS Issue Fixed**

   - Successfully deployed with wildcard origin and proper headers
   - Frontend now connects to `/health` endpoint without CORS errors
   - All API routes now allow cross-origin requests

2. ❌ **Recommendations API Issues**
   - Both v1 and v2 recommendations endpoints return 500 errors
   - These are server-side errors unrelated to CORS configuration
   - Further investigation required to diagnose and fix

## Diagnostic Tools Created

1. **`test-cors-config.sh`**

   - Verifies CORS headers are correctly configured
   - Tests preflight requests and actual API calls
   - Shows HTTP headers and response data

2. **`test-api-endpoints.sh`**

   - Tests all major API endpoints with detailed output
   - Shows request/response headers and bodies
   - Helps diagnose specific API issues

3. **`fix-recommendations-api.sh`**

   - Examines backend code for recommendations API issues
   - Checks routes, controllers, and database connections
   - Provides deployment option after fixes are made

4. **`test-frontend.sh`**
   - Examines frontend API integration code
   - Checks for API URL configuration and error handling
   - Helps diagnose frontend-specific issues

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. Run `./test-api-endpoints.sh` to get detailed diagnostics of the recommendations API failure
2. Check Vercel logs for the specific error message in the recommendations endpoint
3. Fix issues in the backend code based on error diagnosis
4. Redeploy with `./deploy-api-cors-fix.sh`
5. Test frontend integration after backend fixes

### Future Considerations

1. Implement better error handling in the frontend for API failures
2. Add fallback mechanisms when specific endpoints fail
3. Set up automated tests for all API endpoints
4. Enhance monitoring and logging for API errors

## Documentation

- See `API-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed steps on resolving 500 errors
- See `CORS-FIX-SUMMARY.md` for documentation on the CORS fix that was implemented
- All diagnostic tools include help text and instructions

## Conclusion

The CORS configuration issue has been successfully resolved, allowing the frontend to connect to the API. The next focus is on fixing the recommendations API endpoints which are returning 500 errors. The diagnostic tools created will help identify and resolve these issues efficiently.
