# ChasquiFX API Vercel Deployment Summary

## Overview

The ChasquiFX API has been prepared for deployment to Vercel as serverless functions with MongoDB integration. This document summarizes the changes made and the next steps required to complete the deployment.

## Changes Made

1. **MongoDB Integration**

   - Created optimized MongoDB client for serverless environment (`mongodb-vercel.js`)
   - Removed dependencies on Supabase and PythonBridge
   - Updated controllers to use MongoDB directly

2. **Vercel Serverless Configuration**

   - Created API route handlers in `/api` directory
   - Updated `vercel.json` with optimized routing
   - Added environment variable templates
   - Fixed mixed routing properties error by using consistent modern format

3. **API Endpoints**

   - Created health check endpoint for monitoring
   - Adapted existing forex endpoints for serverless architecture
   - Added database status endpoint

4. **Deployment Automation**
   - Created GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
   - Added deployment documentation

## Deployment Issues Resolved

### 1. File Naming Conflicts

Fixed conflicts between files with the same base name but different extensions:

- Renamed `test-atlas-connection-v2.js` to `mongodb-atlas-connection-test.js`
- Added `.vercelignore` file to exclude shell scripts and non-production files
- Created documentation about Vercel file naming requirements

### 2. Mixed Routing Properties

The deployment was failing due to mixing old and new routing formats in `vercel.json`. This was fixed by:

- Converting all `routes` entries to the newer `rewrites` format
- Updating property names from `src`/`dest` to `source`/`destination`
- Ensuring consistent use of the modern routing property format

Before:

```json
"routes": [
  { "src": "/api/v2/forex/rates", "dest": "/api/forex?rates=true" }
]
```

After:

```json
"rewrites": [
  { "source": "/api/v2/forex/rates", "destination": "/api/forex?rates=true" }
]
```

### 3. CORS Configuration

Added proper CORS configuration to allow requests from the frontend domain:

- Updated Express CORS middleware to include `https://chasquifx-web.vercel.app`
- Added CORS headers directly in Vercel configuration

## Next Steps

To complete the deployment, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Vercel Account and Project**

   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   npm install -g vercel

   # Login to Vercel
   vercel login

   # Link to existing project or create new one
   cd backend/api
   vercel link
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables in Vercel**

   - MONGODB_USER
   - MONGODB_PASSWORD
   - MONGODB_HOST
   - MONGODB_DBNAME
   - LOG_LEVEL

3. **Deploy to Vercel**

   ```bash
   # Deploy to Vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Update GitHub Repository Secrets**
   Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository for automated deployments:

   - VERCEL_TOKEN
   - VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
   - VERCEL_ORG_ID

5. **Update Frontend API References**
   Update any frontend API references to use the new Vercel URL:

   ```javascript
   const API_BASE_URL = "https://chasquifx-api.vercel.app";
   ```

6. **Test the Deployment**
   - Test health endpoint: https://chasquifx-api.vercel.app/health
   - Test forex endpoints:
     - https://chasquifx-api.vercel.app/api/v2/forex/rates?from_currency=USD&to_currency=EUR
     - https://chasquifx-api.vercel.app/api/v2/forex/status
