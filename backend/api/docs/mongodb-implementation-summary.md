# ChasquiFX MongoDB Implementation Summary

**Project**: ChasquiFX  
**Task**: MongoDB Migration and Implementation  
**Date Completed**: May 19, 2025  
**Author**: Luis Vinatea

## Overview

The MongoDB integration for ChasquiFX has been successfully completed. This document serves as a handover summary of the implementation, highlighting the key aspects, challenges addressed, and current state of the MongoDB integration.

## Implementation Highlights

1. **MongoDB Atlas Integration**

   - Successfully set up MongoDB Atlas cloud cluster: `chasquifx.ymxb5bs.mongodb.net`
   - Implemented secure authentication using environment variables
   - Added connection pooling and proper error handling

2. **Collection Design**

   - Created three main collections:
     - `forex`: For currency exchange rate data
     - `flights`: For flight route and pricing information
     - `geo`: For geographical data (primarily airports)
   - Implemented appropriate indexes for optimized queries
   - Added source tracking to all documents

3. **Data Migration**

   - Successfully migrated all data from JSON files to MongoDB:
     - 46,188 geo documents (airports)
     - 46 forex documents
     - 32 flights documents
   - Developed robust JSON parsing to handle problematic files
   - Implemented template-based import for certain data types

4. **Verification and Testing**
   - Created comprehensive verification scripts to validate imports
   - Implemented tests for MongoDB connection and operations
   - Added CRUD test scripts to ensure proper database functionality

## Working Scripts

| Script                     | Purpose                 | Location                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| final-mongodb-import.js    | Main data import script | `/backend/api/scripts/` |
| verify-mongodb-data.js     | Data verification       | `/backend/api/scripts/` |
| test-atlas-connection.sh   | Connection testing      | `/backend/api/scripts/` |
| MONGODB_SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.md | Documentation           | `/backend/api/scripts/` |

## Next Steps for the Team

1. **Application Integration**

   - Update the application services to use MongoDB instead of filesystem
   - Implement proper caching strategies using MongoDB TTL indexes
   - Add MongoDB connection pooling to handle concurrent requests

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Implement additional indexes based on query patterns
   - Add aggregation pipelines for complex data operations
   - Set up MongoDB performance monitoring

3. **Maintenance**
   - Implement automated backups for MongoDB data
   - Set up alerts for MongoDB connection issues
   - Create documentation for MongoDB operation and maintenance
