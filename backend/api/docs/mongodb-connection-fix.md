# MongoDB Atlas Connection Fix

## Issue Summary

After extensive testing, we've identified that the MongoDB connection is correctly set up to use ES module syntax, but there's an authentication failure with the MongoDB Atlas credentials.

## Investigation Results

- The MongoDB Atlas hostname `chasquifx.2akcifh.mongodb.net` is valid and resolves correctly
- SRV records are properly configured and pointing to MongoDB servers
- The authentication is failing with error: "bad auth : authentication failed"
- All connection string formats tried resulted in the same authentication error
- The ES modules import/export syntax is correctly configured in the codebase

## Recommendations

### 1. Verify MongoDB Atlas Credentials

The current credentials in the `.env` file are not working. Here are some steps to fix this:

- Log into the [MongoDB Atlas dashboard](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
- Go to "Database Access" under Security
- Check if the user "paulobarberena" exists
- If it does, reset the password and update the `.env` file
- If it doesn't, create a new database user with appropriate permissions

### 2. Check Network Access

Make sure your current IP address is allowed in the MongoDB Atlas Network Access settings:

- Go to "Network Access" under Security in the MongoDB Atlas dashboard
- Add your current IP address or use "Allow Access from Anywhere" for testing

### 3. Verify Cluster Status

Ensure the MongoDB Atlas cluster is running and not paused:

- Check the cluster status in the MongoDB Atlas dashboard
- If paused, resume the cluster

### 4. Update Connection Code

The MongoDB connection code has been updated to use ES module syntax and follows best practices:

- Removed deprecated options (`useNewUrlParser`, `useUnifiedTopology`)
- Using proper import/export syntax
- Implemented proper error handling and logging

### 5. Testing Connection

After updating credentials, run the test scripts to verify connection:

```bash
node tests/test-atlas-connection.js
```

## Next Steps

Once the authentication issue is resolved, the MongoDB connection should work properly with the ES modules setup that has been implemented.
