# MongoDB Connection Migration

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of the ChasquiFX backend MongoDB connection to a new MongoDB Atlas cluster. The application has been successfully updated to work with ES modules and connect to the new MongoDB Atlas cluster.

## Changes Made

### 1. MongoDB Connection Configuration

- Updated the MongoDB connection URI to use the new cluster: `chasquifx.ymxb5bs.mongodb.net`
- Updated authentication credentials to use the new user: `luisvinatea`
- Removed deprecated options (`useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology`) from mongoose connection
- Ensured proper ES module syntax throughout the codebase

### 2. Connection Test Scripts

Several test scripts were created to validate the connection:

- `tests/mongoose-connection-test.js`: Tests basic Mongoose connection
- `tests/direct-connection-test.js`: Tests direct MongoDB client connection
- `tests/mongodb-crud-test.js`: Tests CRUD operations with both MongoDB client and Mongoose
- `tests/comprehensive-connection-test.js`: Detailed connection tests with extensive logging

### 3. Verified Operations

The following operations have been verified to work correctly:

- Connection to the new MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Authentication with the new credentials
- Database operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Both direct MongoDB client and Mongoose ORM functionality

## Current Configuration

```javascript
// MongoDB Atlas connection URI with credentials from environment variables
const username = encodeURIComponent(process.env.MONGODB_USER);
const password = encodeURIComponent(process.env.MONGODB_PASSWORD);

// Get MongoDB host and database name from environment variables or use defaults
const host = process.env.MONGODB_HOST || "chasquifx.ymxb5bs.mongodb.net";
const dbName = process.env.MONGODB_DBNAME || "chasquifx";

// Connection URI
const MONGODB_URI = `mongodb+srv://${username}:${password}@${host}/${dbName}?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=ChasquiFX`;

// Mongoose connection options
const options = {
  serverApi: {
    version: ServerApiVersion.v1,
    strict: true,
    deprecationErrors: true,
  },
};
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be set:

```env
# Required
MONGODB_USER=username
MONGODB_PASSWORD=password

# Optional (defaults will be used if not provided)
MONGODB_HOST=chasquifx.ymxb5bs.mongodb.net
MONGODB_DBNAME=chasquifx
```

## Testing the Connection

To verify the MongoDB connection is working correctly, run:

```bash
# Test basic Mongoose connection
node tests/mongoose-connection-test.js

# Test CRUD operations
node tests/mongodb-crud-test.js
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues:

1. Verify the MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
2. Check that your IP address is allowed in MongoDB Atlas Network Access settings
3. Confirm the environment variables are correctly set
4. Check for any changes in authentication requirements from MongoDB Atlas

## Next Steps

- Set up proper collections and schemas for the application data
- Implement data migration scripts if needed
- Configure database indexing for performance optimization
- Implement proper error handling for database operations in the application logic
