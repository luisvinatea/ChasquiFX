# ChasquiFX Dual Backend Implementation Plan

This document outlines specific implementation tasks to clean up the ChasquiFX dual backend architecture.

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. Fix Node.js Adapter Functions in Python

The existing `node_adapter.py` file has several implementation issues:

- [ ] Update imports and function signatures to match actual functions in services
- [ ] Fix error handling and return types
- [ ] Add proper documentation for all adapter functions
- [ ] Add data validation for all inputs

### 2. Complete Node Bridge Implementation

The `node_bridge.py` file needs to be completed:

- [ ] Add remaining route implementations
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Add data validation
- [ ] Add logging for all operations

### 3. Remove Duplicate API Routes

To avoid confusion and maintenance issues:

- [ ] Identify all Python API routes that are now handled by Node.js
- [ ] Mark them as deprecated in code and documentation
- [ ] Update the Python API README to direct users to the Node.js API

### 4. Update Node.js Service

The Node.js `pythonBridge.js` service:

- [ ] Add proper error handling for Python process failures
- [ ] Add timeout handling for long-running Python operations
- [ ] Implement connection pooling to avoid spawning too many Python processes
- [ ] Add proper logging for Python process events

## Short-Term Tasks

### 5. Standardize Error Handling

Create a consistent error handling strategy:

- [ ] Define error codes that are shared between Node.js and Python
- [ ] Create error translation functions to ensure consistent user-facing messages
- [ ] Implement proper stack trace capture and logging in both systems

### 6. Improve Data Exchange

Optimize data flow between Node.js and Python:

- [ ] Define standard data exchange formats
- [ ] Add validation for all data crossing the bridge
- [ ] Consider compression for large data transfers

### 7. Update Documentation

Ensure documentation reflects the new architecture:

- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Create developer guides
- [ ] Add architecture diagrams

## Long-Term Tasks

### 8. Performance Optimizations

Improve the performance of the dual backend:

- [ ] Profile Python operations to identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Consider binary serialization formats for large data transfers

### 9. Testing Strategy

Develop a testing strategy for the dual backend:

- [ ] Create integration tests that cover the Node.js to Python bridge
- [ ] Implement mock objects for Python services in Node.js tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for both backends

### 10. Monitoring and Observability

Add proper monitoring:

- [ ] Implement health checks for both systems
- [ ] Add metrics collection for bridge operations
- [ ] Set up alerts for bridge failures

## File-by-File Changes

### Python Files to Update

1. `/backend/api/main.py`:

   - Mark duplicate routes as deprecated
   - Add warnings for direct API access

2. `/backend/api/adapters/node_adapter.py`:

   - Fix function implementations
   - Add proper error handling
   - Add input validation

3. `/backend/api/node_bridge.py`:
   - Complete implementation of routes
   - Add proper error handling
   - Add logging

### Node.js Files to Update

1. `/backend/node/src/services/pythonBridge.js`:

   - Add error handling
   - Add timeout handling
   - Improve process management

2. `/backend/node/src/controllers/forex.js` and `recommendations.js`:
   - Ensure proper error handling from Python bridge
   - Add input validation
   - Add caching for expensive operations

## Dependencies and Setup

Ensure both environments have the necessary dependencies:

### Python Dependencies

```
pandas
pyarrow
fastapi
uvicorn
```

### Node.js Dependencies

```
axios
python-bridge
express
```

## Testing the Integration

1. Create test cases that cover:

   - Successful data flow between Node.js and Python
   - Error handling
   - Performance under load

2. Test the API endpoints from the client perspective to ensure seamless integration

## Rollout Strategy

1. Implement changes in a feature branch
2. Test thoroughly in a staging environment
3. Roll out changes gradually, monitoring for issues
4. Document any API changes for client developers
