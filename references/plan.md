## Company Description

**Company Name:** FXGetaway (Placeholder, subject to branding refinement)  
**Legal Structure:** Estonian e-Residency Company (OÜ - Limited Liability Company, to be finalized under Estonian law)  
**Company History:** FXGetaway was conceived in March 2025 to harness exchange rate fluctuations for affordable luxury travel. Founded by Luis Vinatea, leveraging his Brazilian-Peruvian background and global market expertise, the venture kicked off with customer surveys confirming traveler interest in currency-driven savings (target: 500 responses by Q2 2025, currently TBD%). Initial B2C app prototyping began mid-2025, focusing on purchasing power parity (PPP) differentiation, with a goal to complete an MVP by Q3 2025 (progress: TBD%).

**Mission:** To democratize luxury travel by making it affordable through exchange rate advantages, while boosting economic growth in devalued-currency regions.  

**Vision:** To lead the global PPP-driven travel market, creating a balanced, economically impactful tourism ecosystem. *Goal:* Achieve 1% market share ($6 billion SOM) within 18 months, tracking progress quarterly.

**Problem We Solve (Deeper Dive):**  
The travel industry overlooks currency fluctuations, underserving travelers and devalued economies:  
- **For Consumers:** Travelers miss savings and luxury due to limited PPP awareness. Research shows 59% use online platforms for inspiration but lack currency-value tools ([TravelPerk, 2025](https://www.travelperk.com/blog/online-travel-booking-statistics/)). *Goal:* Educate 10,000 users on PPP benefits via app within 6 months.  
- **For Devalued Economies:** Tourism businesses in regions like Latin America struggle to attract global visitors despite high value, due to weak reach and currency challenges ([Destinations International](https://destinationsinternational.org/blog/currencies-and-tourism)). *Goal:* Onboard 50 businesses in 3 months, driving $50,000 in platform revenue.  

FXGetaway acts as an **economic bridge**, connecting value-seeking travelers with undervalued destinations. *Progress Tracking:* Measure user growth and business revenue against targets monthly.
