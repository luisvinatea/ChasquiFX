# Business Plan

## Company Description

**Company Name:** FXGetaway (Placeholder, subject to branding refinement)  
**Legal Structure:** Estonian e-Residency Company (OÜ - Limited Liability Company, to be finalized under Estonian law)  
**Company History:** FXGetaway was conceived in March 2025 to address the untapped potential of affordable luxury travel driven by exchange rate fluctuations. Founded by Luis Vinatea, leveraging his dual Brazilian-Peruvian background and expertise in global markets, the venture began with early customer research via surveys identifying traveler interest in currency-driven travel savings. Initial prototyping of the B2C app interface started in mid-2025, focusing on purchasing power parity (PPP) as a core differentiator.  

**Mission:** To democratize luxury travel by making it more accessible and affordable through strategic use of exchange rate advantages, while driving economic growth in regions with devalued currencies.  

**Vision:** To become the leading global platform for PPP-driven travel, fostering a balanced and economically beneficial tourism ecosystem.  

**Problem We Solve (Deeper Dive):**  
The travel industry fails to fully capitalize on currency fluctuations, leaving both travelers and devalued economies underserved:  
- **For Consumers:** Travelers miss out on significant savings and luxury experiences due to a lack of awareness about PPP. Research shows 59% of travelers use online platforms for inspiration but lack tools to assess currency-driven value ([TravelPerk, 2025](https://www.travelperk.com/blog/online-travel-booking-statistics/)). Pain points include high costs in familiar destinations, limited knowledge of affordable alternatives, and inefficient currency conversion processes.  
- **For Devalued Economies:** Tourism businesses in regions like Latin America or Africa struggle to attract international visitors despite offering exceptional value, exacerbated by weak marketing reach and currency devaluation ([Destinations International](https://destinationsinternational.org/blog/currencies-and-tourism)). This leads to underutilized potential and economic stagnation.  

FXGetaway bridges this gap by curating travel opportunities based on PPP, acting as an **economic bridge** that connects value-seeking travelers with undervalued destinations, benefiting both parties.
