# ChasquiFX Project Update Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. File Naming Conflicts

- **Issue**: Vercel deployment failed due to file naming conflicts
- **Error**: `Two or more files have conflicting paths or names. Please make sure path segments and filenames, without their extension, are unique.`
- **Resolution**: Renamed conflicting files to have unique base names:
  - `test-atlas-connection-v2.js` â†’ `mongodb-atlas-connection-test.js`
  - Updated shell script to reference the renamed file
  - Updated documentation references

### 2. Vercel Deployment Configuration

- Added `.vercelignore` file to exclude shell scripts and other files not needed for production
- Updated `vercel.json` with improved configuration to handle file conflicts
- Created documentation on Vercel file naming requirements

## Added or Modified Files

### Scripts

- **deploy-api.sh**: Enhanced with conflict detection before deployment
- **commit-and-push.sh**: Added to simplify GitHub updates

### Backend API

- **mongodb-atlas-connection-test.js**: Renamed from test-atlas-connection-v2.js
- **test-atlas-connection-v2.sh**: Updated to reference the renamed JS file
- **.vercelignore**: Added to exclude files not needed for deployment
- **vercel.json**: Updated with improved CORS and build configuration

### Documentation

- **backend/api/docs/vercel-file-naming-requirements.md**: New documentation on Vercel file naming requirements
- **backend/api/src/db/README.md**: Updated file references

## Next Steps

1. Push changes to GitHub using `./commit-and-push.sh`
2. Deploy the API using `./deploy-api.sh`
3. Verify the deployment by visiting the API health endpoint
4. Test the frontend application integration with the backend API

## Future Recommendations

1. Use unique base names for all files regardless of extension
2. Organize files by type and purpose in separate directories
3. Use the deployment script's conflict detection before every deployment
4. Update the `.vercelignore` file as new non-essential files are added to the project
